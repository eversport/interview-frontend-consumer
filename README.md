## TASK

### Create a venue overview page

#### Current behavior
Eversports offers venues the possibility to manage their courts. For Eversports it’s important that the venue owners are working closely with our tool. Based on previous analysis we know that the more courts a venue owner is offering on Eversports, the more actively they are using our tool. E.g. a venue that offers 5 or more courts has only a 2% chance to cancel their contract. That’s why it’s important for our business to know how many courts a venue owner is offering on Eversports. The goal is that owners are offering at least 5 courts.

#### Desired behavior
Show a list of venues with their courts to know which venues offer more less than 5 courts.
