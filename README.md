## TASK


### Create a facility overview page

#### Current behavior
Eversports offers facilities the possibility to manage their courts. For Eversports it’s important that the facility owners are working closely with our tool. Based on previous analysis we know that the more courts a facility owner is offering on Eversports, the more actively they are using our tool. E.g. a facility that offers 5 or more courts has only a 2% chance to cancel their contract. That’s why it’s important for our business to know how many courts a facility owner is offering on Eversports. The goal is that owners are offering at least 5 courts.

#### Desired behavior
Show a list of facilities with their courts to know which facilities offer more less than 5 courts.
